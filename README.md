# webshop
Small project of what could be a webshop of dog clothing and accessories

Created as a school project. Initially to demonstrate HTML and CSS knowledge. Later on this project was used again for another course where optimization skills were showcased.
I've used google lighthouse to identify areas that could be improved upon, some points found was setting width and height in HTML to avoid cumulative layout shifts and converting the images to webp.

Only Home (index.html) and analys are available pages, the other pages are only there to demonstrate the menu layout.
